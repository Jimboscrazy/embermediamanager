#summary Ember Media Manager Changelog

*Changes in upcoming release:*
 * Disable doublebuffering on main form as a fix to the "black status bar" issue
 * Ability to open read-only files
 * Changed versioning again. I wrote a powershell script to automatically get the proper version from svn to make it easier on me.
